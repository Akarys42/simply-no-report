# No Chat Reporting

This mod gives the option to server admins to disable chat reporting, by converting chat messages to system messages, 
in a non-intrusive way.

Disabling is done through the `disableChatReporting` gamerule and is set to false by default, to let server admins
decide whether that's something they want or not.

Note that this mod will probably break other mods that modify chat messages.
